# Training Plan

## Review Criteria

* If a team of sponsors is proposed, is the team structure well justified for the mentored training plan, and are the roles of the individual members appropriate and clearly defined? 
* Are the qualifications of any collaborator(s) and/or consultant(s), including their complementary expertise and previous experience in fostering the training of fellows, appropriate for the proposed project? 
* Is the proposed research project of high scientific quality, and is it well integrated with the proposed research training plan? 
* Is the research project consistent with the candidate’s stage of research development? 
* Is the proposed time frame feasible to accomplish the proposed training? 
* Does the training plan provide adequate opportunities to present and publish research findings and meet with scientists in the community at national meetings as the work progresses?
* Will the training plan provide the professional skills needed for the candidate to transition to the next stage of their research career? 
* Are the proposed research project and training plan likely to provide the candidate with the requisite individualized and mentored experiences in order to obtain appropriate skills for a research career? 
* Does the training plan take advantage of the candidate’s strengths and address gaps in needed skills? Does the [Training Plan](Training_Plan.md) document a clear need for, and value of, the proposed training? 
* Does the proposed training have the potential to serve as a sound foundation that will clearly enhance the candidate’s ability to develop into a productive researcher? 
* Are the research facilities, resources (e.g., equipment, laboratory space, computer time, subject populations, clinical training settings) and training opportunities (e.g. seminars, workshops, professional development opportunities) adequate and appropriate? 
* (For clinical training) If the applicant is proposing to gain experience in a clinical trial as part of his or her research training, is there evidence of the appropriate expertise, experience, resources, and ability on the part of the sponsor(s) to guide the applicant during the clinical trial research experience?
* (For clinical training) If proposed, will the clinical trial experience contribute to the proposed project and/or the applicant’s research training? 


## Suggestions and Ideas

* Make sure to crossreference training plan and research plan.
* Add a timeline of activities, integrating research milestones.
