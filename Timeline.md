## Planning Worksheet

## Which Fellowship Should I Apply For?

While our focus is on NRSA F31 proposals there are many other fellowhsips that support trainees.  Here are some other resources:

* Johns Hopkins Database of Graduate Student Funding Opportunities: https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/graduate/
* American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowships: https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/predoctoral-fellowship 

## Structure of the Modules

* Each module will have some background information, a worksheet and some resources.
* For each module we will note the review criteria at the top.  It is important that for each document you clearly respond to each of these questions, providing the best possible evidence to support your proposal.
