# Orientation and Planning

This session will serve as an introduction and planning section, as well as a panel discussion from prior F31 recipients.  Slides for this session can be found [here](Documents/Slides/Orientation.pptx).

## Planning Worksheet

Please download and fill out this [worksheet](Documents/Planning_Worksheet.docx) before the session and answer all these questions to the best of your ability.

## Which Fellowship Should I Apply For?

While our focus is on NRSA F31 proposals there are many other fellowhsips that support trainees.  Here are some other resources:

* Johns Hopkins [Database of Graduate Student Funding Opportunities](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/graduate/)
* American Heart Association [Predoctoral Fellowships](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/predoctoral-fellowship)

## Structure of the Modules

* Each module will have some background information, a worksheet and some resources.
* For each module we will note the review criteria at the top.  It is important that for each document you clearly respond to each of these questions, providing the best possible evidence to support your proposal.  For a some suggestions on where reviewers will look for the answers to these questions see [this document](Review_Criteria_NRSA.md).  We will refer to that regularly.

## What Will I Need to Write?
