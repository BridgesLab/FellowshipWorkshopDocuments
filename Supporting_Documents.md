# Supporting Documents

Slides for today can be found [here](Documents/Slides/Supporting%20Documents.pptx).

You will need several supporting documents, which we will work on all together.  This includes the following

### Letters of Support

These are distinct from your letters of reference, but instead should be letters that describe the support of your research and your training plan.

### Facilities

Key cores and resources available for training and research

### Key equipment

Critical equipment needed for your studies.

### Training in Responsible Conduct of Research

Must describe in one page each of the following aspects of your RCRS:

1. **Format** – the required format of instruction
2. **Subject Matter** – the breadth of subject matter
3. **Faculty Participation** – the role of the sponsor(s) and other faculty involvement in the fellow’s instruction
4. **Duration of Instruction** – the number of contact hours of instruction (at least eight contact hours are required)
5. **Frequency of Instruction** – instruction must occur during each career stage and at least once every four years
### Authentication of Resources

Key resources (mice, antibodies, chemicals) need to be validated.  For more details see [NOT-OD-17-068](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-068.html)

### Resource Sharing Plans

How develeoped resources (mice, tools, computational resources, sequence data) will be shared.  For more details see [Model Organism Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/other-sharing-policies/model-organism-sharing-policy) and [Research Tools Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/other-sharing-policies/research-tools-policy)
