# Fellowship Writing Workshop

This site contains documents and information for a fellowship writing workshop sponsored by the [Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute](https://diabetes.med.umich.edu/), first offered in Spring 2024.  If you are interested in joining the CDI Learning Community, or participating in this or future workshops please email [Dave Bridges](mailto:davebrid@umich.edu).

The main goal is to support trainees in writing F31 applications, so these materials are based on [PA-23-272](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-23-272.html).

# Organization and Plan

We will host workshops every other week with a brief faculty talk and peer review of each other's documents

## Workshop structure

* **Before the meeting**: First complete the worksheet for each week, then using that information write drafts of the relevant sections.  Upload these by Friday before the meeting.
* **During the workshops**: There will be a faculty-led mini-lecture on the topic, followed by peer review of each participant's documents (and food).
* **After the workshops**: Revise your documents based on the discussions.
