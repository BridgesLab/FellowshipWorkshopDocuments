# Fellowship Writing Workshop

This site contains documents and information for a fellowship writing workshop sponsored by the [Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute](https://diabetes.med.umich.edu/), first offered in Spring 2024.  If you are interested in joining the CDI Learning Community, or participating in this or future workshops please email [Dave Bridges](mailto:davebrid@umich.edu).

The main goal is to support trainees in writing F31 applications, so these materials are based on [PA-23-272](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-23-272.html).

# Organization and Plan

First, make sure you know your due date and contact your unit's grants administrator to start the process of starting a proposal approval form (PAF).  The structure of the workshops will be to read the information in these documents and prepare drafts of each section, submitting them to the Dropbox folder by *Monday*, and then on *Wednesday* there will be a faculty-led mini-lecture on the topic, followed by peer review of each participant's documents.
