# Fellowship Writing Workshop

This site contains documents and information for a fellowship writing workshop sponsored by the [Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute](https://diabetes.med.umich.edu/), first offered in Summer 2025.  If you are interested in joining the [CDI Learning Community](https://diabetes.med.umich.edu/enrichment-training-funding/training-mentoring), or participating in this or future workshops please email us at [TrainingandMentoringAdmin@umich.edu ](mailto:TrainingandMentoringAdmin@umich.edu).


The main goal is to support trainees in writing F31 and F32 applications, so these materials are based on [PA-23-272](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-23-272.html) and [PAR-25-234](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-234.html).

# Organization and Plan

We will host workshops every other week with a brief faculty talk followed by peer review of each other's documents.  We will meet *in person* from 11-12 at North Campus Research Center B20 Rm 2814:

## Workshop structure

* **Before the meeting**: First complete the worksheet for each week, then using that information write drafts of the relevant sections.  Upload these by Wednesday before the meeting to our shared [dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/xuzkawkb5zwt9neu6tfnz/AAa9wY-1SMDd_i4EG4Md7Jc?rlkey=k6mla0hmrm7ki6sushehpno8a&st=kc7vfuva&dl=0).  Try to read each other's submissions before the meeting
* **During the workshops**: We will start with peer review of each participant's documents (and food), and follow this up with a mini-lecture to prepare for the next week's documents.
* **After the workshops**: Revise your documents based on the discussions.
