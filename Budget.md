# Budget Justification

Use this [worksheet](https://github.com/BridgesLab/FellowshipWorkshopDocuments/raw/refs/heads/2025-Jan-CDI/Documents/Budget_Worksheet.docx) to start your budget.

## Review Criteria

Not applicable, but do need to justify the number of years of additional training needed.  Only allowable expenses are allowed.  You should briefly describe each of these expenses.

## Suggestions and Ideas

Work with your unit's grants administrator for this, they should know these numbers.

### Stipend

State the stipend amount requested, referencing the current [NIH NRSA stipend rates](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-104.html) (not your salary or UM stipend).

* For F31: Use the predoctoral stipend rate (currently $28,224).
* For F32: Use the appropriate postdoctoral stipend rate based on years of experience.

### Tuition and Fees (if needed)

* For F31: List the actual tuition and fees charged by the institution (candidate level).  Explain that NIH will reimburse 60% of tuition and fees (up to the NIH cap, currently $16,000 per year for F31).  
* For F32: tuition and fees are only allowed if they are necessary for specific coursework or degree-granting programs that support the [career development plan](Training_Plan.md).  Count this per credit ($3,608/credit nonresident or $2,329/credit for Michigan residents)

### Institutional Allowance

Specify the institutional allowance amount (currently $4,750/year for F31, $12,400/year for F32).  Briefly describe how these funds will be used (*e.g.*, health insurance, research-related expenses, travel to scientific meetings, books, and supplies).

### Childcare Costs (if applicable)

If requesting, state the amount (up to $3,000/year) and specify that it is for childcare provided by a licensed provider.

## General Guidance

* Clearly explain any year-to-year increases in costs (*e.g.*, tuition increases) and provide justification for each.
* Do not request funds for research costs (*e.g.*, reagents, equipment) beyond what is covered by the institutional allowance-these are not permitted for F31/F32 awards.
