# Support for Trainees

The overall plan for trainee and mentor planning is shown here, this includes some mentor-specific activities and some that are specific to each group.  Our primary theme areas are to provide support in the areas of science, professional development, and community.

## Existing Resources for Trainees

### List of Trainees and Ways to Keep it Up to Date

Check in with mentors annually and verify that these are their trainees, add in people who attend workshops or events.  Would require mostly administrative support.

### K Club and K Workshops

This is run through MICHR, more information at https://michr.umich.edu/offering/k-writing-workshop/

### Future of Metabolic Physiology Symposia

This was run last year by Dave, Costas, and Brigid with support of CDI and the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/michigan-neuroscience-institute/events/202405/future-metabolic-physiology-symposium.  Could be done annually.

### Research Clubs and Seminars

Already running, would advertise these through newsletters and the website.  Should think about how to prioritize trainees for lunches with [speakers](#co-ordinating-meetings-with-speakers).

## Resources to Develop

### Writing Groups

These would be student-run drop-in writing groups targetting students working on papers, theses and dissertations.  Would require minimal faculty input but administrative support to find times and set up zooms.

* **Goals** To connect students who are writing, build connections
* **Measureables and Evaluation** Attendance

### F31/F31 Bootcamps

Four week seminar covering how to write a competitive award.  Focus will be mainly on professional development and structure of application, with the mentor providing most of the scientific support (see https://bridgeslab.github.io/FellowshipWorkshopDocuments/) for outline.  Would involve pretty substantial planning and reading to set up, plus administrative support for getting rooms booked and food.

* **Goals** To help students write competitive F31s
* **Measureables and Evaluation** Attendance, and to increase the number of F31 submissions and awards from F31 trainees.

### Co-ordinating Meetings with Speakers

Try to find ways to identify students who would be interested in meeting with speaksers, both from [seminars](#research-clubs-and-seminars) and from [alumni](#alumni-meetings-and-seminars).  Would need to come up with a plan on how to contact students ([newsletter](#trainee-newsletter) and [email list](#list-of-trainees-and-ways-to-keep-it-up-to-date).

* **Goals** Provide students with more access to visiting speakers.
* **Measureables and Evaluation**  Number and variety of students that meet with speakers.  

### Technical Workshops

This could integrate with the [monthly professional development workshops](#regular-monthly-trainee-workshops).  Ideas could be core presentations, RNAseq/scRNAseq analyses, image analyses, etc.

### Soliciting Nominations for External Awards

The goal is to nominate our trainees for more awards.  Need to identify award mechanisms from key conferences and societies and think about how to help package nomination materials.  Could also include knowing if CDI trainees are nominated/win Rackham Awards (see https://rackham.umich.edu/discover-rackham/announcing-the-2024-2025-rackham-predoctoral-fellowship-awards/).

### Alumni Meetings and Seminars

To allow trainees to meet with our alumni, with a special emphasis on non-academic careers.

### Regular Monthly Trainee Workshops 

A regular meeting where students both interact and can get professional development support.  Some ideas here include:

* IDPs
* Mentoring undergrads
* Career paths
* Finding funding
* Building your brand
* Job searches
* Mock chalk talks
* Teaching skills and opportunities

### CDI Awards

These would include trainee and researcher awards.  Ideally with a nominal prize.

### Trainee Newsletter

In order to share achievements and information to and about trainees, a monthly newsletter.  This will be a centralized place to share information about [workshops](#regular-monthly-trainee-workshops), [seminars](#research-clubs), [awards](#cdi-awards), and other relevant information.  This could also be a venue to let students know about upcoming speakers they may want to [meet](#co-ordinating-meetings-with-speakers). I also would like to use this to develop peer-generated trainee profiles where trainees interview each other and we post those.  Would need a template and an updated list of trainees.

### Social Events


### Service Opportunities


### Games/Challenges

Both mentors and mentees

### Website Updates and Social Media

Could also include sharing the newsletters.  This should also be a centralization of resources, could include links to training programs (T32, Postbac, MSURE) as well as events.

### Networking and Coffees
