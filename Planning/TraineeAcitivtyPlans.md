# Support for Trainees

The overall plan for trainee and mentor planning is shown here, this includes some mentor-specific activities and some that are specific to each group.  Our primary theme areas are to provide support in the areas of science, professional development, and community.

## Existing Resources for Trainees

### List of Trainees and Ways to Keep it Up to Date

### K Club and K Workshops

This is run through MICHR, more information at https://michr.umich.edu/offering/k-writing-workshop/

### Future of Metabolic Physiology Symposia

This was run last year by Dave, Costas, and Brigid with support of CDI and the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/michigan-neuroscience-institute/events/202405/future-metabolic-physiology-symposium.  Could be done annually.

### Research Clubs and Seminars

## Resources to Build

### Writing Groups

### F31/F31 Bootcamps

### Co-ordinating Meetings with Speakers

### Technical Workshops

This could integrate with the [monthly professional development workshops](#regular-monthly-trainee-workshops).  Ideas could be core presentations, RNAseq/scRNAseq analyses, image analyses, etc.

### Soliciting Nominations for External Awards

The goal is to nominate our trainees for more awards.  Need to identify award mechanisms from key conferences and societies and think about how to help package nomination materials.  Could also include knowing if CDI trainees are nominated/win Rackham Awards (see https://rackham.umich.edu/discover-rackham/announcing-the-2024-2025-rackham-predoctoral-fellowship-awards/).

### Alumni Meetings and Seminars

To allow trainees to meet with our alumni, with a special emphasis on non-academic careers.

### Regular Monthly Trainee Workshops 

A regular meeting where students both interact and can get professional development support.  Some ideas here include:

* IDPs
* Mentoring undergrads
* Career paths
* Finding funding
* Building your brand
* Job searches
* Mock chalk talks
* Teaching skills and opportunities

### CDI Awards

These would include trainee and researcher awards.  Ideally with a nominal prize.

### Trainee Newsletter

In order to share achievements and information to and about trainees, a monthly newsletter.  This will be a centralized place to share information about [workshops](#regular-monthly-trainee-workshops), [seminars](#research-clubs), [awards](#cdi-awards), and other relevant information.  I also would like to use this to develop peer-generated trainee profiles where trainees interview each other and we post those.  Would need a template and an updated list of trainees.

### Social Events


### Service Opportunities


### Games/Challenges

Both mentors and mentees

### Website Updates and Social Media

Could also include sharing the newsletters.

### Networking and Coffees

## Things We Need and Next Steps

### Administrative Support Needed for these Tasks

- [ ] Substantial administrative support for [symposia](#future-of-metabolic-physiology-symposia)
- [ ] Updated trainee list, and a robust mechanism to keep it up to date

### Faculty Time Needed for these Tasks

- [ ] Co-ordinating with administrative support
