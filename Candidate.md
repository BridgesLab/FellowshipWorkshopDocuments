# Candidate Information

## Review Criteria

* Are the candidate's academic record and research experience of high quality? 
* Does the candidate have the potential to develop into an independent and productive researcher? 
* Does the candidate demonstrate commitment to a research career in the future?
* Does the training plan take advantage of the candidate’s strengths and address gaps in needed skills? Does the training plan document a clear need for, and value of, the proposed training?
* Does the proposed training have the potential to serve as a sound foundation that will clearly enhance the candidate’s ability to develop into a productive researcher? 
* (For clinical training) Is there evidence of a match between the research and clinical interests (if applicable) of the candidate and the sponsor(s)? Do(es) the sponsor(s) demonstrate an understanding of the candidate’s training needs as well as the ability and commitment to assist in meeting these needs? 
* (For clinical training) If proposed, will the clinical trial experience contribute to the proposed project and/or the applicant’s research training? 


## Suggestions and Ideas

![Puzzle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Jigsaw_puzzle_01_by_Scouten.jpg)

Think of the grant as a partially complete puzzle.  First you want to describe what pieces are in place.  This is who you are as a candidate and shoule be in the introduction.  Then there should be a clear description of what *you* think the puzzle will look like when its complete.  This is you as a trianed scientist after this training is complete.  The missing pieces should be what goes in your training plan, and should be obvious from the descriptions of you now, and what you hope to become.

It is best to write this document along with the personal statement section of your biosketch.  Here are the [NIH fellowhsip biosketch instructions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-h/general/g.240-r&r-seniorkey-person-profile-(expanded)-form.htm#Instructions).  Both documents should highlight your background and accomplishments to date. 

Very early in the application you should give the reviewer a clear sense of who you are right now, and what you hope to become by the end of this funding period.  This will be part of the document **Applicant's Background and Goals for Fellowship Training**.  The first part of the candidate information is section A.  "Doctoral Dissertation and Research Experience".  We will cover sections B (Training Goals and Objectives) and C (Activities Planned Under this Award).  We will cover these latter two sections in the [Training Plan](Training_Plan.md) document.

> From the [NIH instructions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-e/general/g.430-phs-fellowship-supplemental-form.htm#2): Briefly summarize your past research experience, results, and conclusions, and describe how that experience relates to the proposed fellowship. In some cases, a proposed fellowship may build directly on previous research experiences, results, and conclusions. In other situations, past research experiences may lead a candidate to apply for a fellowship in a new or different area of research. Do not list academic courses in this section.  Include a narrative of your planned doctoral dissertation (may be preliminary).

### Defining Yourself Now

To be a recipient of funding you should be advancing to candidate, so describe your past and key accomplishments up to and including advancing to candidacy.  This should include brief descriptions of:

* Your motivation for a career in research.
* Undergraduate education and research experiences.  
* Key doctoral coursework and skills attained.

Together these should provide a clear picture of you as a scientist right now, or the partially completed puzzle.  These should be things that you can point to as either 

### Projecting Yourself into the Future

At the end of this funding period,
