# Sponsor's Statement

Worksheet

## Review Criteria

* Does the candidate have the potential to develop into an independent and productive researcher? 
* Does the candidate demonstrate commitment to a research career in the future? 
* Are the sponsor(s) research qualifications (including recent publications) and track record of mentoring individuals at a similar stage appropriate for the needs of the candidate? 
* Is there evidence of adequate research funds to support the candidate’s proposed research project and training for the duration of the research component of the fellowship? 
* If a team of sponsors is proposed, is the team structure well justified for the mentored training plan, and are the roles of the individual members appropriate and clearly defined? 
* Does the sponsor's research and training record, as well as mentoring statement, indicate that the candidate will receive exceptional training in the proposed research area and have the opportunity to publish high quality papers and present research data at national meetings as the project progresses? 
* Does the training plan provide adequate opportunities to present and publish research findings and meet with scientists in the community at national meetings as the work progresses?
* Are the proposed research project and training plan likely to provide the candidate with the requisite individualized and mentored experiences in order to obtain appropriate skills for a research career?
* Does the training plan take advantage of the candidate’s strengths and address gaps in needed skills? Does the training plan document a clear need for, and value of, the proposed training?
* Does the proposed training have the potential to serve as a sound foundation that will clearly enhance the candidate’s ability to develop into a productive researcher?
* Are the research facilities, resources (e.g., equipment, laboratory space, computer time, subject populations, clinical training settings) and training opportunities (e.g. seminars, workshops, professional development opportunities) adequate and appropriate? 
* Is the institutional environment for the candidate’s scientific development of high quality? 
* Is there appropriate institutional commitment to fostering the candidate’s mentored training?
* Is there evidence of a match between the research and clinical interests (if applicable) of the candidate and the sponsor(s)? Do(es) the sponsor(s) demonstrate an understanding of the candidate’s training needs as well as the ability and commitment to assist in meeting these needs? 

## Suggested Format

Based on instructions [here](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-e/general/g.430-phs-fellowship-supplemental-form.htm#9) there should be the following sections (below is from that ilink)

### A. Research Support Available
In a table, list all current and pending research and research training support specifically available to the applicant for this particular training experience. Include funding source, complete identifying number, title of the research or training program, name of the PD/PI, start and end dates, and the amount of the award. If the sponsor's research support will end prior to the end of the proposed training period, the sponsor should describe a contingency plan for how the fellow's research will be supported.

The role of the sponsor/co-sponsor in the Research Training Plan should be described. If one or more co-sponsors is proposed, this plan should describe the role of each sponsor and how they will communicate and coordinate their efforts to mentor the applicant effectively.

### B. Sponsor's/Co-Sponsor's Previous Fellows/Trainees
State the total number of predoctoral and postdoctoral individuals previously sponsored. Select up to five that are representative, and for those five, provide information on their time spent in the lab, their present employing organizations, and their present position titles or occupations.

### C. Training Plan, Environment, Research Facilities
The applicant's Research Training Plan should be individualized for the applicant, keeping in mind the candidate's strengths and any gaps in needed skills. The Research Training Plan should be designed to enhance both research and clinical training (if applicable).

Describe the Research Training Plan that you have developed specifically for the fellowship applicant. Be sure to include the following points:

Include items such as classes, seminars, opportunities for interaction with other groups and scientists, and any professional skills development opportunities.
Describe the research environment and available research facilities and equipment.
Indicate the relationship of the proposed research training to the applicant's career goals.
Describe the skills and techniques that the applicant will learn. Relate these to the applicant's career goals.
The information contained in the "Training Plan, Environment, Research Facilities" section of the Sponsor's and Co-sponsors' Statements should be coordinated with information provided under the Description of Institutional Environment and Commitment to Training attachment below.

F30 Applications: The Research Training Plan should provide opportunities to integrate clinical experiences during the research training component; a plan for a smooth transition to the clinical training component; and should have the potential to facilitate the applicant's transition to a residency or other program appropriate for his/her career goals. Sponsors and co-sponsors should discuss these clinical aspects of the applicant's training as well.

F31, F32, F33 Applications: The Research Training Plan should facilitate the applicant's transition to the next stage of his/her career. Sponsors and co-sponsors should discuss this aspect of the applicant's training as well.

### D. Number of Fellows/Trainees to be Supervised During the Fellowship
Indicate how many pre- and/or post- doctoral fellows/trainees the Sponsor/Co-sponsor is expected to supervise during the award period. Co-sponsor statements must also include this information.

### E. Applicant's Qualifications and Potential for a Research Career
Describe how the fellowship applicant is suited for this research training opportunity based on his/her academic record and research experience level. Include information about how the Research Training Plan, and your own expertise as the sponsor or co-sponsor, will assist in producing an independent researcher.

Note: If the applicant is proposing to gain experience in a clinical trial as part of his or her research training, then the sponsor or co-sponsor should include information in the statement to document leadership of the clinical trial (in addition to the information above). Include the following:

Source of funding;
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (e.g., NCT87654321), if applicable;
A description of how your expertise is appropriate to guide the applicant in any proposed clinical trials research experience; and
A statement/attestation that the sponsor will be responsible for the clinical trial.
The sponsor must have primary responsibility for leading and overseeing the trial and must describe how he/she will provide this oversight (be careful to not overstate the fellow's responsibilities).
Include details on the specific roles/responsibilities of the fellow and sponsor, keeping in mind that the terms of a fellowship award do not permit the fellow to lead a clinical trial.

## Letters of Support 

In addition to this sponsors statement, you will need letters of support from key collaborators and resources.  This should include both scientific letters of support, and potentially other mentors (such as review committee members).  These are separate from your letters of reference which are submitted anonymously and separate from these letters.
