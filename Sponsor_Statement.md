# Sponsor's Statement

## Review Criteria

* Does the candidate have the potential to develop into an independent and productive researcher? 
* Does the candidate demonstrate commitment to a research career in the future? 
* Are the sponsor(s) research qualifications (including recent publications) and track record of mentoring individuals at a similar stage appropriate for the needs of the candidate? 
* Is there evidence of adequate research funds to support the candidate’s proposed research project and training for the duration of the research component of the fellowship? 
* If a team of sponsors is proposed, is the team structure well justified for the mentored training plan, and are the roles of the individual members appropriate and clearly defined? 
* Does the sponsor's research and training record, as well as mentoring statement, indicate that the candidate will receive exceptional training in the proposed research area and have the opportunity to publish high quality papers and present research data at national meetings as the project progresses? 
* Does the training plan provide adequate opportunities to present and publish research findings and meet with scientists in the community at national meetings as the work progresses?
* Are the proposed research project and training plan likely to provide the candidate with the requisite individualized and mentored experiences in order to obtain appropriate skills for a research career?
* Does the training plan take advantage of the candidate’s strengths and address gaps in needed skills? Does the training plan document a clear need for, and value of, the proposed training?
* Does the proposed training have the potential to serve as a sound foundation that will clearly enhance the candidate’s ability to develop into a productive researcher?
* Are the research facilities, resources (e.g., equipment, laboratory space, computer time, subject populations, clinical training settings) and training opportunities (e.g. seminars, workshops, professional development opportunities) adequate and appropriate? 
* Is the institutional environment for the candidate’s scientific development of high quality? 
* Is there appropriate institutional commitment to fostering the candidate’s mentored training?
* Is there evidence of a match between the research and clinical interests (if applicable) of the candidate and the sponsor(s)? Do(es) the sponsor(s) demonstrate an understanding of the candidate’s training needs as well as the ability and commitment to assist in meeting these needs?
